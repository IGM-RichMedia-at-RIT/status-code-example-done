      need to convert our response to text and then parse that as JSON. JSON is so common that
      the fetch API handles it innately.

      response.json() is an asychronous call that runs on a background thread. This is because
      some json responses can be tremendously large, and processing them takes time. We don't want
      to call the content.innerHTML code below until we have processed the response, so we can
      use the await keyword to await a "fulfilled" promise from response.json().
      */

    /*A helper function for sending our fetch request. Read init first.

      You will note that sendFetch takes in the url as a parameter. Right before the
      parameter list there is the "async" keyword. In the last demo (Accept Header) we
      discussed the fetch API, and how the fetch() function returns a promise. One way
      we can work with promises is by using the await/async structure which can make our
      code much cleaner and clearer to read.

      Functions that run asynchronous code often times return a promise. Normally when
      we create a promise, we then need to add event handlers to it like .then() (which
      we did in the last demo). However, this can create a large set of nested function
      calls especially if we have multiple promises contained within one another.
      The await/async syntax seeks to elimitate this.

      Let's first look at the line "let response = await fetch(url);". We know the call
      "fetch(url)" is an asynchronous call that returns a promise. We could store that
      promise and then say something like promise.then(...). In that .then() we could
      handle the response we get back from the server.

      The code below is doing almost the exact same thing, but instead of using a callback
      function passed into the .then() handler, we are instead saying "make a fetch call
      to the url. (a)WAIT until the fetch has completed, and store the response in the
      response variable. THEN call handleResponse". Essentially what we are doing is turning
      the usually non-blocking asychronous call "fetch" into a blocking call. The fetch() is
      still asynchronous, but we are pausing the code within sendFetch until it completes.

      To be able to use the await keyword in a function, we need to mark that function as
      being "async", so that the compiler/interpreter knows that the code contained within
      is async, even though the await makes it look synchronous. Being clear: the below
      code is functionally identical to the promise.then() code we saw in the Accept Header
      demo. It simply looks cleaner.

    const sendFetch = async (url) => {
      //Call fetch, wait til we get a response, and then store that response in the variable.
      let response = await fetch(url);

      //Call handleResponse with the response we got back from the server.
      handleResponse(response);
    };

    /*init is the starting point of our client side code. Below the function, we
      have window.onload = init, which means that init will automatically be called
      when the page loads.
    */
    const init = () => {
      //Grab references to all the buttons on the page.
      const successButton = document.querySelector("#success");
      const badRequestButton = document.querySelector("#badRequest");
      const notFoundButton = document.querySelector("#notFound");

      /*As discussed in the Accept Header demo, we want to have our buttons call some
        code when they are clicked. To do this, we need a function that we can call that
        doesn't have any parameters. Since sendFetch (the function we want to call) does
        have parameters. We can make functions with no parameters that call the function
        with the parameter prefilled.

      const badRequest = () => sendFetch('/badRequest');
      const notFound = () => sendFetch('/123');

      //Once we have the above functions, we can hook them up to the click events of each button.

    <h3>Status Code Tests</h3>

      <p>Disclaimer: in a real application, you wouldn't be requesting specific status codes from the server.
        You would instead be making a request like: "give me info about cats" and the server may respond
        with a 200-Success and info about the cats. Or a 400-BadRequest saying "You haven't specified enough about
        what you want", or with a 404-NotFound saying "I don't know how to tell you about cats".
